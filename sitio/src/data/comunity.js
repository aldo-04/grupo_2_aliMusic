        description: 'Hi everyone! I am working with an independent band and we thought it would be super beneficial to develop instagram support groups for fellow artists.These instagram support groups would be a way for fellow artists to support, engage, and promote each others content! When ever someone in the group makes a post, just send it to the group message via instagram where members can like, comment, repost or share the post. Such an easy and great way to support each other.If interested in joining a group, just comment with the instagram account youâ€™d like to join with or send me a DM.Thank you:)',
